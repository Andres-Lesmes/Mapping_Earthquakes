# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Overview
In this module we are creating a html file that uses data from three different sources to map the last 7 days earthquakes, major earthquakes and the tectonic plates. In this map we also add a marker that displays the magnitude and location of each earthquake. Moreover, we have the option to switch on and off independently each set of data. Furthermore, the map has three different map styles (streets, streets satellite and light). The earthquake circles radius and color depend on the earthquakes magnitude; and we added a color legend that relte the color and earthquake magnitude.
